# Image-Embedding-through-CNN-Models-and-Stacking-Ensemble
Optimizing image embeddings for image similarity using various deep CNN models and Stacking Ensemble Technique.

This project explores the use of three deep CNN models (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) to extract image embeddings from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The models are evaluated using the mAP@5 metric to measure their performance. Fine-tuning and hyperparameter tuning are applied to further enhance the model performance. To improve embedding extraction, a Stacking Ensemble Technique is implemented, combining the strengths of the individual models. K-Means clustering visualizes the embedding clusters generated by each model, and KNN is employed to retrieve and display similar images based on the embeddings.
